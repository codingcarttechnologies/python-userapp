Tasks Done:
1. Set up a basic django 1.9 installation using a sqlite database in the same folder as the
source
2. Add two fields to the User model using a migration:
	1. a birthday field of type date
	2. a random number field of type integer that is assigned a value from 1-100 on
		creation
3. Create views for listing all users, viewing, adding, editing and deleting a single user
4. Create two template tags:
	1. A tag that will display "allowed" if the user is > 13 years old otherwise display
	"blocked"
	2. A tag that will display the BizzFuzz result of the random number that was
	generated for the user. The BizzFuzz specification is that for multiples of three
	print "Bizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Fuzz". For
	numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "BizzFuzz"
	3. Add a column to the list view after the birthday column that uses the
	allowed/blocked tag
	4. Add a column to the list view after the random number column that uses the
	BizzFuzz tag
